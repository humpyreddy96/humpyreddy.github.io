- Worked on a tool developed using the Qt framework that helps in post-flight analysis of the missile telemetry data on guided missile systems.
- Uses regex to identify string patterns and keywords, then interprets these using a custom built data-dictionary and presents them to the user for post-flight data analysis and configurations through well-defined GUI elements.
